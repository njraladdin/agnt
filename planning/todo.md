[ ] browser : agnet shouldnt have to manualyl genreate page map, it's sometihng that autoamtically happens before nad after any browser action
also, do we include page mapsi n prompts? reimplement what we were doing in the ai scrpaing backend

[ ] FIX agent not really receiving the page map
[ ] a way to debug sent system instructions (with a plugin)
[ ] simplfy debugging, no need for too much options

[ ] page map should alwyas be generated before and after any action, if the browser is open
[ ] agnet stil manually calls generate_page_map(), remove that
[ ] fix refs not working (due to not porting the tools module)
